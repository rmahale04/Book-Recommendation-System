# ðŸ“š Book Recommendation System

A machine learning and web-based project that recommends books to users based on their interests and preferences.  
The system uses **content-based filtering** and **collaborative filtering** techniques to deliver personalized book suggestions, and is deployed as a **Flask web application**.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Project Description
The purpose of this project is to build a **personalized book recommendation engine** that helps readers discover books similar to their tastes.  
The system analyzes user data (ratings, preferences, or search history) and book metadata (title, author, genres, etc.) to provide intelligent recommendations.  

This project was developed as part of an academic group project to demonstrate skills in **machine learning, data science, database management, and web development**.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Purpose
- To apply recommendation system algorithms in a real-world use case.  
- To demonstrate **data preprocessing, analysis, machine learning, and web deployment**.  
- To design a system that can later be expanded with additional features.  
- To showcase technical and analytical skills for academic and internship purposes.

## ðŸ”¹ Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Framework**: Flask (for web application)  
- **Libraries**:  
  - Pandas & NumPy â†’ Data handling  
  - Scikit-learn â†’ Machine learning algorithms  
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn â†’ Data visualization  
- **Algorithms**:  
  - Content-based Filtering  
  - Collaborative Filtering  
- **Database**: MySQL (or CSV dataset for prototype)  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Types of Recommendations
1. **Content-Based Filtering** â†’ Suggests books similar to the ones a user likes, based on attributes (author, genre, description).  
2. **Collaborative Filtering** â†’ Suggests books based on ratings and preferences of similar users.  

*(Future enhancement: Hybrid Recommendation System combining both approaches.)*

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- Personalized book recommendations.  
- Similar book suggestions based on metadata.  
- User preference-based collaborative recommendations.  
- Web-based interface using Flask.  
- Scalable design for future deployment.  
- Data visualization for analysis of recommendation performance.
